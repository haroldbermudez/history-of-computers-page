<h1>History of Computing</h1>
    <p>Technology- it is everywhere. We see phones, televisions, computers, etc.  We use them mostly everyday, everywhere.  Computers have helped us in many ways, and we should be thankful for them.  So how did it start?  Whatâ€™s the history behind it?  Computers have been around for a few centuries, and they have changed our lives.  We went from the calculating machine, the abacus, to smart phones that become popular worldwide.  From time to time, we have been from generation to generation, and we will continue to grow with computing.
