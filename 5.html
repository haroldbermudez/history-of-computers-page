<h1>History of Computing</h1>
    <p>Technology- it is everywhere. We see phones, televisions, computers, etc.  We use them mostly everyday, everywhere.  Computers have helped us
        in many ways, and we should be thankful for them.  So how did it start?  What is the history behind it?  Computers have been around for
        a few centuries, and they have changed our lives.  We went from the calculating machine, the abacus, to smart phones that become popular
        worldwide.  From time to time, we have been from generation to generation, and we will continue to grow with computing.
    </p>
        <h2>Abacus</h2>

        <div>
            <p> Around 500 B.C, the chinese invented the very first computing device, the Abacus.  It was a math machine used as what we call today
        “calculating board”.   It was a tool that was used mostly in Russia, China, and Europe, and is still used in those countries today.  It was
        invented most likely because it is very difficult to count without numbers. “Merchants who traded goods needed a way to keep count
        (inventory) of the goods they bought and sold.”  The abacus was not used the same way calculators are being used today.  People used mental
        math, and physically the abacus(or counting boards) to keep count of the sums, carries, etc.
    </p>
        <h3>Calculators(Blaise Pascal)</h3>

            <p>Calculators followed the abacus.  It was discovered in 1623 by Wilhelm Schickard when he reported “that he designed and had built the earliest of
        the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation.”  However, he failed when studies have shown that his calculator inventions was shown to be damaged,
        if pressing the same dials, and jamming it.  He died 11 years later, abandoning the project.  In 1642, however, Blaise Pascal, was able to finish the
        project and “solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator.” It was manufactured two hundred years later, and continued
        to be used for 40 years as the first successful calculator machine.  Calculators were developed from time to time.

        <h4>Microcomputers</h4>

            <p>In 1972, Bill Pentz and his team, built the very first microcomputers at Sacramento State University, which they called the Sac State 8008.  However,
                because it was not too popular, other models of the microcomputers took the lead.  “The Altair 8800, designed by the Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry
                Systems group in Albuquerque, N.M., was powered by the Intel 8080 microchip and was introduced to the mass market in 1975.”(Reference 2016).

         <h5>Apple and Microsoft (Steve Jobs and Bill Gates)</h5>
         <img src="http://blogmobility.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/apple.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">

            <p>Apple and Microsoft are two of the biggest technology companies in the whole country.  Microsoft was born in April 4, 1975, Albuquerque, NM, while Apple
                was born a year later in April 1, 1976, Cupertino, CA.  Apple “designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.
                ”(Wiki).  It went from their very first product, Apple l, to iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macintosh.   Microsoft is a corporation “that develops, manufactures,
                licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft
                Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers.”(Wiki).  These two companies has been founded
                by Steve Job and Bill Gates.  Not only has Steve Jobs founded Apple, he also made Pixar, Disney, and NexT.  Bill Gates created code language during his days of microsoft.

            <h6>Internet(Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf)</h6>

              <p>“The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide. It
                  is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad
                  array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies”(Wiki).  You can do almost anything on the internet- Make orders, view videos or pictures,
                  get information, etc.  The two creators of the internet are Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf.  Kahn was the founder of the Fundamental Communication, and Transmission control.
                  “He was awarded the SIGCOMM Award in 1993 for ‘visionary technical contributions and leadership in the development of information systems technology’ ”(Wiki).
                  Vint Cerf was instrumental in the funding and formation of ICANN from the start.  He is currently in many organizations that help the internet grow in many different ways.
                  The internet was born around 1960.
